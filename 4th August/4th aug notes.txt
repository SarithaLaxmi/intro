--> Architecture :: API-First-Approach

Martin Fowler :

Chris Richardson :

https://microservices.io/patterns/index.html

==> What are the different message exchange pattern?

- Point-to-point
- Request-Reply/response
- Event Driven Architecture == Pub-Sub model

==> What is the need for Solace? OR What is the need for Event Broker Services?

- With time :: The service versions will modify 
- Everytime a service is updated ---> Inform all the susbcribers
- Subscribers :: What is the version the subscriber wants to work with

Netflix/Banking apps/Twitter/etc : Complex + large apps --> Tons of services [country/region specific]


==> How does the services manage the request-reply model + Ingress-Egress flow how the state/permission/A&A would be managed [A&A - authentication and authorization]

API's :

- Public API's : FB API
- Private API's : FB Advertisement Engine :: B2B contract --> FB Private API's :: A&A

https://developer.linkedin.com/

Free version of LinkedIn :: Fetch the user details

Suddenly --> No data/no profile that could be fetched

There was an endpoint update :: initial : http://<endpoint> ----------> https://<endpoint>

Real estate :: Broker --> Record of all the available flats/PG's/Apt
Zomato/Swiggy/Uber/Ola --> Brokers :: Facilitation :: <Consumer> vs <Business>

Middleware :: Event Broker Services [EBS]

- EBS keeps a track of the incoming and outgoing request-response OR messages
- EBS ==> State of the messages :: How long should be the msg be available/who would have access to what messages
- EBS ==> Ingress-Egress facilities are handled well

Ingress --> Incoming requests
Egress --> Outgoing responses

==> Few million events that gets generated on a regular basis :: Capacity + Throttle

a. What is the capacity of the tool/software/hardware to handle the request
b. Subscribers --> Consume + Process :: What speed the subscriber can consume the data + Event is consumed BUT there is an error in consumption --> who will handle the error :: EBS

c. How to handle the failover mechanism 

d. Subscriber :: NO more events for next 30 mins


==> How can I work with Solace? What are the different ways by which we can interact with Solace env :

a. PubSub+ cloud
b. CLI
c. Solace API's 

Solace :

- Event Broker Service :: PubSub+ OR Solace API's 
- Appliances

Solace API's :

- Solace supports multiple languages
- Solace supports multiple protocols 

https://solace.com/downloads/ --> Solace API's : Multiple language support :: C/Java/.NET/iOS/Python/NodeJS/etc

WebGUI :: PubSub+ Cloud or PubSub+ software :: Using the Solace API's

NodeJS : Sync + Async

NodeJS :: 

- How can I setup the servers/how to read files in NodeJS

NodeJS ::

a. Open source + free
b. Syntaxes of NodeJS is easier for beginner 
c. Extremely memory friendly footprint :: Mobile apps/IoT apps 
d. Tons of documentation
e. Java_Script based framework :: Server side framework
f. With NodeJS :: Request-Response model :: Send and receive data based on the HTTP request 

Try the programs either in VM/local machine :: NodeJS

- NodeJS env
- Notepad++
- CMD

NodeJS --> NPM :: Node Package Manager : https://www.npmjs.com/

CentOS --> package management --> RPM packages :: RPM : Redhat package manager

NodeJS :  Request-Response model :: Send and receive data based on the HTTP request 

VM :: C:/nodecode

Save a NodeJS file :: What is the extension :: .js

File name: server.js

To execute a NodeJS code with an editor like Notepad++ ::

CMD --> Navigate to the directory [where the NodeJS code is present] --> node server.js [node <filename with extension[.js]]

Hostname : 127.0.0.1

What is this IP address? :: Loopback address

Execute the server env in our local machine :: 3 different local IP address::

- localhost
- 0.0.0.0
- 127.0.0.1

Whenever an IP address ::

Loopback : 127.0.0.1
DHCP/DNS/Default Gateway : Wi-fi :: 10.x.x.x

College network :: 192.168.x.x

Classes in IP Addresses : 

Class A : 0-126 : WAN

Class B : 128-191 : MAN + Large internal n/w

Class C : 192 - 223 : LAN

Class D : 224 - 239
Class E : 240-255

<127.0.0.1> : Loopback address


Port Numbers :: 

23 --> Not working
9090 --> working
21 --> Not working
2121 --> Working

Computers : Hardware + Software apps :

1. Physical Ports : USB port/Ethernet port - Hardware ports

2. Software apps :: Virtual Ports :: 0-65535

0-1200 :: Reserved for system protocols

http: 80
https: 443
FTP : 21
Telnet : 23

1201 - 1300 :: Research purpose

1301 - 65535 :: Custom applications

Apache Server/Http server : 8080/9090/2121/3000 [NodeJS]

MySQL Database :: 3306/3307

http.createServer((req, res) ::

http :: Package :: Ensuring the request-response model is working

(req, res) :: parameters :

req --> request being sent to the server
res --> response from the server 

Where is this server running ::

<hostname>:<port number> 

127.0.0.1: 2121

Status Code :

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes

All protocols communicate using Status Code :: True/False

res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')

We can pass different types of content :: API/Request-Response/Web Service ::

a. Text/Plain
b. text/html
c. XML
d. JSON
e. image

PubSub+ Cloud :

- Event Portal - Designer [design EDA apps + Catalog - Events | Schema | Application]
- Event Streaming
- Event Insights

DB Schema --> Structure of the tables ==> What is the meta information of the tables

Solace --> Schema ::

Schema :: A set of guidelines/rules --> Set some properties + restrictions/validations

test-employee-details  :: Define the rules for creating employee dataset 

employee-first-name : string [min-max value]
employee-age : int [min-max value]

Storing the data rules :: In which format the rules are being specified :: 

- JSON
- XSD :: XML Schema Definition :: Schema pattern
- DTD :: Document Type Definition
- protobuf :: API driven approach

XML --> Validation of XML data was done using DTD --> XSD

Schema in Solace ::

Application Domain :: What is the industry type of the project :: Banking-domain
Rules & Validation :: Define the schema :: Schema style :: JSON/XSD/DTD/Protobuf + Define the data format

Schema :: Application Domain ==========> <EBS Logic --> Data from the publisher --> check]

Zomato --> Every order amount :: Float type and NOT integer

EBS Transformation : Zomato-SmartWatch-App --> New Order --> Order value [int] =========> Event/msg [EBS :: check what is the data type of the order value] --> [EBS : int --> float [100 --> 100.00]] =========> Subscriber

What is done with Cluster Manager? 

Solace :: 2 types of event brokers ::

a. Software based :: Create in the PubSub+ 
b. Hardware based :: Appliance -> v3530/v3560

==> Solace PubSub+ : Create an instance of Solace EBS 

Whenever a new service is created :: Service has to be depolyed :: 

Google.co.in --> Mumbai DC/Noida of Google

Different locations of the DC's of AWS

Services [Login/Audit/New order/product service/video service] --> Services are deployed in some DC

EBS Instances :: Creating a Event Broker Service :: Deployed in a Datacenter --> That are supported by Solace

EBS Instance [Account type in Solace - Developer Service class --> restriction : 1 EBS/account]  ---------------> All the activities of Solace event broker

EBS Creation : https://console.solace.cloud/services/create


Developer ::

100 connections ::  Developer class --> Total number of client connection that the EBS can handle
10GB Storage :: Developer class --> Storage size of the EBS


EBS Instance [Account type in Solace - Developer Service class --> restriction : 1 EBS/account]  ---------------> All the activities of Solace event broker :: Different objects

- Message/event data storage
- Pub-Sub :: Event --> Topics --> messages 
- Account activities
- Queues
- Topics
- Event mechanisms
- Logs

100 connections ::  Developer class --> Total number of client connection that the EBS can handle ::

--> term used is CLIENT and NOT Publisher-Subscriber

--> Client ===> Business

PaaS Environment :: PaaS --> Platform as a Service :: More you use, more you pay || Less you use, less you pay

100 connections :: Concurrent/Simmultaneous :: At a time
