Solace Console --> Manage --> Queues --> Queue Templates --> <Inside a template> :: "Client Profile"

Solace Console --> Manage --> Queues --> <Inside a specific queue> :: Owner [Edit] :: "Client-usernames"

What is client profile & client-usernames

Console --> Manage --> Access Control --> 

a. Client Profiles --> cannot create a new client profile from access control
b. ACL Profiles --> Create the ACL profile from the access control
c. Client Usernames --> Can create client-username from access control

What is ACL? :: Access Control List

MQ-Training : MS Team link1 for MQ :: Authorized to attend the training :: Allowed or Denied

Comm-Training : MS Team link2 for MQ :: Authorized to attend the training :: Allowed or Denied

Solace-Training : MS Team link3 for MQ :: Authorized to attend the training :: Allowed or Denied

Who all can access your Gmail account : Users --> Allowed or Denied

Workspace/Any other resource on the network OR on internet :: Will have permissions associated [Accees] :: Allowed | Denied

ACL : Networks :: 

Every activity that you do :: As a user/client :: Try to access the system/resources/network/infrastructure :: Permission :: Allow | Deny

ACL : Access Control List

ACL Matrix :: 

Objects vs Users

Objects :: Solace Objects [Message-VPN, Queues/QT/Topics/Pub-Sub]

Users :: The services [MSA] which tries to communicate with Solace Objects

https://docs.solace.com/Security/ACL.htm

ACL --> Create some rules :: What/who is allowed and who is NOT ==> Policy

Message-VPN :: message-spool + ACL Profiles

1. There will be policies based on the access criteria
2. Access criteria :: Objects + Users

3. Objects --> Solace objects 
4. Users/client-usernames --> Clients who would want to connect to the message-VPN + clients who wants to pub-sub messages in EBS

Create a client-username : cu01

- Enable : ON or OFF

-->Whenever a Client-Username is created :: 2 bindings that needs to be done :

a. Client-Profile
b. ACL-Profile

Inside a client-username :

- Stats
- Queues owned by this client-username
- Topic endpoints owned by this client-username


Step1 : Access Control --> Client Username --> Created a new client-username :. Enabled + Client profile + ACL profile :: Default 

Step 2: Inside the newly created client-username + check --> queues/topic owned

Step3 : Created a new queue --> assigned the owner with the newly created Client-username

Step4 : Check the client-username --> queue ownership is available or not

==> Create the client usernames using Solace CLI

1. Create and configure the client-username

enable
configure

solace-primary-0(configure)# : 


create the client-user

create client-username <username> message-vpn <message-vpn-name> 

create client-username cucli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

(configure/client-username)#

2. Configure in Client-user : assign the ACL Profile


a. Go inside the client-username :

client-username <username> message-vpn <mvpn-name> 

client-username cucli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

-solace-primary-0(configure)# client-username cucli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

--> Assign a ACL profile to the CU

(configure/client-username) : acl-profile <name of the profile> 

acl-profile default

3. Configure in Client-user : assign the Client-Profile

(configure/client-username) : client-profile <name>

client-profile default

(configure/client-username)# client-profile default

4. To see the list of the client-usernames :

(configure/client-username)# show client-username *

5. Enabling/Disabling of the client-username 

(configure/client-username)# no shutdown

ACL Profile :: Policies :: Allowed or Denied


Solace console --> Manage --> Access Control --> ACL Profiles

Client-usernames :: connect to a message-vpn


ACL profile : acp01


a. Client-connect : If the ACL profile is binded to a client-username : is it for Allow or Deny

b. Publish Topic : Whether the client-username with which "this" ACL profile is binded : will allow  for topic publish

c. Subscribe Topic :  Whether the client-username with which "this" ACL profile is binded : will allow  for topics can be subscribed




Publish Topic --> ACL Profile [client-user] : Allowed :: STOP a few --> list of exceptions

Client-connect --> IP Address :: Address format in exception :: CIDR format

What is CIDR : Classless Inter Domain Routing

IP address :: CIDR format :: With CIDR format, data routing becomes very efficient

192.168.1.10/15
192.168.1.10/24

Step 1: Create the ACL profile :: Allow all 3 permissions 

Step 2: Where can we use the ACL profiles :: Binding the client-usernames

==> Solace CLI :: ACL Profile

--> Create an ACL Profile + Configure the ACL Profile

enable
configure

==> create the acl profile 

create acl-profile <profile-name> message-vpn <mvpn-name>

create acl-profile aclcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

(configure/acl-profile)#

==> Navigate inside the ACL profiles 

solace(configure)# acl-profile <profile-name> message-vpn <mvpn-name>

acl-profile aclcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

==> Configure the ACL profiles :: Client-connect status

(configure/acl-profile)# client-connect

(configure/acl-profile/client-connect)#

Policy/access for the client-connect :: default-action :: allow or deny

(configure/acl-profile/client-connect)# default-action allow

==> Bind a client-username with ACL profile

a. Check the list of client-usernames :: configure mode in CLI --> show client-usernames

exit
exit

(configure)# show client-username *

cucli01 


b. Inside the client-username : 

client-username <username> message-vpn <mvpn-name> 

client-username cucli01  message-vpn message-vpn-01 


c. Bind the username with the ACL profile :

(configure/client-username): acl-profile <profile name>

acl-profile aclcli01

ERROR:  Client Username cucli01 must be shutdown to change the ACL profile
Command Failed

(configure/client-username)# shutdown

developer-production-bc64t4s47ll-solace-primary-0(configure/client-username)# shutdown
All clients using this Client Username will be disconnected.
Do you want to continue (y/n)? y

After the shut-down : 

(configure/client-username)# acl-profile aclcli01

Why the need for the shut down of a client-username IF ACL profile is to be changed?

==> Started a new session :: Further config the ACL profile

enable
configure

(configure)# acl-profile aclcli01

 Invalid command input
        acl-profile aclcli01
                            ^
         -> missing parameter


acl-profile aclcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

==> ACL Profile (configure/acl-profile)# : Set the permission for Publish a topic


(configure/acl-profile)# publish-topic

(configure/acl-profile/publish-topic)

Next step :: Add the permission :: 

default-action allow/deny

(configure/acl-profile/publish-topic)# default-action allow


==> How to set the exceptions in Publish-topic :

(configure/acl-profile/publish-topic)# exception <topic name/structure/taxonomy>

(configure/acl-profile/publish-topic)# exception animals/domestic/cats

-solace-primary-0(configure/acl-profile/publish-topic)# exception animals/domestic/cats
ERROR:  This command can no longer be used. The replacement command is configure

 > acl-profile > publish-topic > exceptions.
Command Failed


-----------------
(configure/acl-profile/publish-topic)# exceptions animals/domestic/cats

 Invalid command input
        exceptions animals/domestic/cats
                   ^
         -> invalid parameter
 Expected one of the following:
      smf                      - Exception list uses SMF topic syntax.
      mqtt                     - Exception list uses MQTT topic syntax.
      list

Working command : exceptions list animals/domestic/cats

exceptions list animals/domestic/cats smf

exceptions list animals/domestic/dogs animals/domestic/rabbit

list : collection :: can be repeated --> update the exception list

exceptions list animals/domestic/dogs animals/domestic/rabbit

==> Subscribe Topic

(configure/acl-profile/publish-topic)# exit

developer-production-bc64t4s47ll-solace-primary-0(configure/acl-profile)#

(configure/acl-profile)# subscribe-topic

developer-production-bc64t4s47ll-solace-primary-0(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)#

==> Permission to the subscribe topic : default-action --> allow | deny

(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# default-action allow


==> Add the exception to the subscribe topic :

(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# exceptions list animals/domestic/>

exceptions list animals/domestic/* smf

Publish-topic or Subscribe-topic in ACL profile :: Exception list :: default protocol is SMF


(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# exceptions list animals/jungle/* mqtt

ACL Pub/Sub-topics :: Exception list :: MQTT --> SMF
 


==> delete

(configure/acl-profile/subscribe-topic)# delete animals/jungle02/*

 Invalid command input
        delete animals/jungle02/*
        ^
         -> unknown command, or command not available in current mode


What is the way to see the details of delete command, if any? 

delete ?

 Invalid command input
        delete ?
        ^
         -> unknown command, or command not available in current mode


How to delete a subscriber-topic exception list of ACL profile using Solace Command

Everything that we create in Solace :: Object

generic commands :

- show
- create

Whenever an entity is to be created :: create <thing> 

==> Solace Console --> Manage --> Access Control --> Client Profiles

Analogy :

1. Vijay : Permission to attend Solace training : ACL 
2. Vijay : Skillsets : Theory/Handson/Comm/Behavioral/Critical thinking/Problem solving : Properties/Configuration :: Client-Profiles

1. What is a client profile in Solace?

https://docs.solace.com/Cloud/client-profiles.htm

Client-username : The pub-sub services/application of the business :: connect + communicate with Message-VPN

a. ACL Profile : What is allowed | denied :: Create a policy matrix :: Client-username vs Objects [publish/subscribe/client connect]


Client Profiles :: Common features/configurations that can applied to different client-usernames || Grouped together

Solace --> Client Profile 

Where can I add the client-profile?

Solace Console --> Manage tab --> Client Profile

Every solace account in PubSub+ Cloud :: Comes with a default client profile

Is it a possible to create a new client profile ? 

Queues [queue 06] --> Binded with an owner [owner --> client-username [cu03]] --> [cu03 --> ACL profile [permissions : allow/deny] + client- profile [set of config]] 

1. Create a new client profile
2. Create a client username :: Bind the CU with a new ACL profile + Client profile
3. Create a new queue :: Bind it with owner --> new client username 

client-profile 

client-username

==> Create client profiles using Solace CLI 

enable
configure

==> Create a client-profile + Configuration

Create a client-profile  : 

create client-profile <name> message-vpn <mvpn-name>

create client-profile cpcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

create client-profile cpcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01

 Invalid command input
        create client-profile cpcli01 message-vpn message-vpn-01
               ^
         -> unknown command, or command not available in current mode


The restrictions placed in the Developer Service Type 

Developer Service Type  --> You cannot access :: Solace CLI + Solace PubSub+ Cloud

- event insight :: Developer service class :: Account is not supported
- Logs being created : Can I open the log files :: Developer Service type :: NO

Solace --> Logs --> Migrate the log files from your a/c to DataDog/Splunk or any other server :: Feature is not supported in the developer service type

==> Client-Profile :: Create the client-profile using GUI BUT not using Solace CLI

Access Control :

- Client-usernames
- ACL profiles
- Client profiles

All these config details, all the permission details, all client username details :: Where are they stored ?  


Solace Console --> Manage --> Access Control --> Client-Authentication

Client Authentication :: Validating :: Against the data :: Data/records that are present ::

A. Internal database - Internal database. Authentication is against Client Usernames.

B. LDAP - LDAP authentication. An LDAP profile name must be provided.

C. RADIUS  - RADIUS authentication. A RADIUS profile name must be provided.


What is LDAP :: Light-Weight Directory Access Protocol 


==> How do you authenticate users in Windows OS?

==> How do you authenticate users in Linux OS?

--> Public Keys or Private Keys :: Key pairs

--> Certificates :: SSL Certificate or TLS Certificate :: Verizon/Symantec

Keys :

- Shared flat :: Key to enter the door [common key - Public key] + Closet --> Personal Key [Private key] 

Communication :: Client [each of the client instances --> Private Keys] <--> Server [Public Key]


Handshake :: Public <==> Private :: matches :: Connection is successful

- Properties of the key :: These keys are encrypted and NOT plain text [HASH :: One way algorithms] 

*nix env :: Key pairs for authentication :: machine[laptop] <==> servers :: USB Keys

How we can create our own key? :: Windows --> PuttyGen

PuttyGen download link : https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html

Generate a key :: 

Click on generate --> Move the mouse randomly in the empty space

Communication :: Encrypted 

My URI [Publisher] ---------[EBS]--------> Server/Subscriber :: Https :: Valid certificates --> ensure that a specific algorithms are used for encryption

128-bit encryption
256-bit encryption
512-bit encryption 

Certificates :: Valid for a specific period of time 

Validity period :

Issued On	Saturday, July 16, 2022 at 12:42:31 PM
Expires On	Thursday, August 17, 2023 at 12:42:31 PM

My URI [Publisher] ---------[EBS]--------> Server/Subscriber :: Where are the solace certificates + what type of certificates does Solace support?

Solace Console --> Manage --> Certificate Authorities 

Types of certificate that Solace uses OOTB [out of the box]:

a. Client Certificate Authorities : Client Certificate Authorities are used to authenticate the identity of the "client to the server"

b. Domain certificate authorities : Domain Certificate Authorities authenticate the identity of the event broker service to clients and other event broker services

NOT allowing to load a sample certificate file ::  validating the "identity of the client to the server."

Client --> My account --> Add a demo certificate
<NO HANDSHAKE --> VALIDATION --> NULL]

Server --> Solace PubSub+ Host --> Nothing on the server side for the cert

- Read
- Start making own notes
- Read the questions carefully 

Scenarios :: Solace CLI :: Read the steps that needs to be done

Create the object :: Use a specific name 

Video files :: email : name the video files in a logical manner :: 

S1_v1
S1_v2
S1_v3
