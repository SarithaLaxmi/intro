Different config that we will be using :: Why that value is being : 

Why :: 

Queue1 : Guaranteed delivery
Q2 : P2P 

--> New_order_service [pub] --> Connected topics + queues + Subscribers + message-spool + message VPN [different config] 

Connected topics + queues + Subscribers :: What are the diffent client-usernames + client-profiles + acl-profiles]

Bridge 


Each participants : 7-8 topics

Group 3 :

1. Topic : News Portal

a. News category subscriptions 
b. Different news topic preferences
c. Paid vs Free service 
d. Customer service : Customer support [tickets can be raised ---> Subscriber services]

==> Beautify :: Ready code base available ==> Python ==> Small module [use the entire code base ==> connect to the host/topics/queues] :: represent a workflow 

Bridges [Dynamic Messaing Routing] : Multiple Event broker services

Customer Login ==> EBS1 

News-Details ==> EBS2

Distributed Systems/High Availability Systems : 

- Distribute the loads across different EBS/Message-VPN
- Business domain actions ==> Customer | News-topic | Payment Services

Type of comm/message exchange pattern : Different types of queues :

- Guaranteed queues
- P2P

Queue Creations ::

2 categories :

1st category:

a. Electronics1 - Mobile

grp1/retail/neworder/electronics/mobile/* - All brand new mobile orders

grp1/retail/neworder/electronics/mobile/refurbished/* - All refurbished new mobile orders

b. Electronics2 - TV

grp1/retail/neworder/electronics/tv/*

2nd category :

Groceries

grp1/retail/modifyorder/items/> - Orders modified --> In a specific basket, what are the items modified


grp1/retail/modifyorder/items/400100-> - Orders modified --> In a specific basket, what are the items modified in zipcode : 400100

Queue --> DMQ

ACL Matrix :: 

- CLient-username :: Allowed | Deny :: Features :: Topics Endpoints + Queue Templates [filter-names] 

Hardware :: Banking project :: How many -physical ports --> 6 ports

--> In the 6 ports :: What are the commands that you will be using to configure the ports + IP addresses of the 6 ports

--> Replace the NAB :: 4 ports ---> 8 ports


Multiple client-usernames :: Different services :: Each client-usernames :: Different ACL Profiles + Client Profiles :: Why this binding is happening

What are the different types of Bridges :

- Static Bridge
- Dynamic Bridge
- Kafka Bridges

What are the different ways by which we can connect to the bridges :

Linking two Message VPNs with different names to enable Direct or Guaranteed messages


Linking two Message VPNs with the same names on two separate event brokers to enable Guaranteed messages published to one Message VPN to be delivered to the other Message VPN.

What are the different types of Bridges :

- Static Bridge
- Dynamic Bridge
- Kafka Bridges

What are the different ways by which we can connect to the bridges : 


- Manual Bridge
- GUI :: Click to Connect

- If the priviliges are available :: Solace CLI

Bridges :: Different EBS/message-VPN :: Concepts :

- Local-VPN [message]
- Remote-VPN [message]

Connect to the remote bridge :

-> Connect using the Broker URL
-> solace cloud credentials --> Use another Solace PubSub+ account

Host List : mr-connection-afoaqbshvkc.messaging.solace.cloud:55443

Remote Host name : mr-connection-afoaqbshvkc.messaging.solace.cloud

55443 : Secure SMF 

if the client-username has the permission to connect to a bridge? 

Access-Control :: Where in the access-control ? --> NOT in ACL-Profile 

Access-Control :: Where in the access-control ? --> 

Client Profile --> Configuration property --> Connect as a Bridge :: [True or False]

Create Profile --> Configuration [Connect as a Bridge] --> Used by Client-usernames --> 

- 2 solace accounts

Create the bridges

Local a/c ==> Enabler for the bridge

34.93.117.63:55443


The bridge is created --> But on the Remote Message :: Bridge status is DOWN ----> UP:: 

How to ensure the bridge status is UP on both the sides? 

Why the bridge status down :

- Is it a config issues?
- Estiablishing Connection Issues ? 
- Config params
- Client Profile --> Client username issues 
--> Other factors?
