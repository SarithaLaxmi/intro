- data plane
- management plane : Monitoring plane :: Event insights + DataDog/Splunk + show <object/thing> details

Control Plane :: 

- Decides how the data is managed --> manages that how the data is routed in the env/network
- Would use different protocols to managge the comm between the different systems
- Identify the routes
- Data Management --> Decisions to be taken : How the data routing + processed + routing

How does it identify what is the best possible route? :: OSPF

==> What is Blade? IBM/Dell/DXC -- Blade Servers

Blade --> Bleed --> High Performance Engineering

Deliver scalability and "high density" with this modular blade server. Designed for HPC, XaaS, and virtualization.

High Density --> Associated with grouping of the resources [CPU/RAM/Storage/Network/etc] 
Modular feature --> Scale-in or scale-out on-demand basis [on need basis] 
Overall concept of blades --> HPC :: High performance computing

HPC --> 

- Extreme high availability
- Extreme high transactions/data transfer
- Speed 

v3530 --> How many slots : 6
v3560 --> How many slots : 8

1. What is Network Accelerator Blade? 

- All the actions/activities related to High Speed I/O in Solace deployments
- Manages all the protocols + Protocol Terminations [SMF/Routing/Finding the best path/Internal]
- Manage : Network Adapters + PCI's [Hardware slots : Mother board] 
- Management Plane

Power --> Cooling process

If upgraded or replaced :: How the power consumption gets modified at the peak of the performance? :: Power Envelope

--> No need to change your apps if horizontally scaling your middleware? 

https://community.fs.com/blog/understanding-link-aggregation-control-protocol.html

LAG : Link Aggregation Group 

LACP : Link Aggregation Control Protocol

Hardwares --> Physical ports : 6-8 

- How the throughput from multiple network connections can be combined together and can be fed into a single connection
- LAG ensures that :: There is redundancy --> In case of failovers, if one of the physical links, the other physical links can work and take backup role

LAG :: Process --> Trunking + Bundling + Bonding + Channeling

Solace --> Appliance --> NAB --> LAG for communication :: High network bandwidth + HAA 

Active & Standby :: Solace --> HAA :: Backup + Redundancy 

In a network : 1 active LAG + Many standby LAG

If an active fails, then one of the standby's will take the active role

Network :: PDC vs BDC

PDC : Primary Domain Controller
BDC : Backup domain controller

In a network : 1 PDC and many BDC || If the PDC fails, one of the BDC's ------> PDC

What are the components that makes Solace architecture distributed? 

What are the steps to be followed in Solace CLI to create client-username? 

Solace [EBS : software/hardware] :: client-username, acl-profile, client-profile

Solace [PubSub+ Solace Cloud]  users? :: 

- Where can we create Solace users? 
- Is it possible to invite users in my account? 
- Who takes care of the user level permissions for Solace? 

- Invite users into our accounts
- Invite the users --> give some permission to the users : Viewer/Admin/Event Portal/Mission Control 

Tech feature : Solace Users --> Permissions for the user access :: IAM : Identity and Access Management 

IAM : Identity and Access Management :: Solace User managment [internal] :: IAM 


IAM vendors:  Microsoft/Oracle/Sailpoint 

How does Solace ensure message order within a topic for subscriber? 

How Solace manages the message-queues ? 

Solace [unique sequence number to each message [message-ID]] --> msg-id

message priorities : 0-9

message being published in a queue - 1 part 

how to specify the priorities for the message being queued - 2 part


MsgID - 1

Message Priority - 2

MsgID - 10

Message Priority - 9

Platinum member of a bank --> Call center number :: Privilege :: HIGH priority : less than 30 sec

Simple member of a bank --> Call center number  :: LOW priority : less than 10 mins

What's the role of Message-VPN in Solace? 

Who will manage the Topic endpoints & queues?  :: Users --> manage access 

- Solace Admin : Manage any of the resource/objects in Solace env
- Developer service type a/c --> Creator of the a/c --> Admin --> manage all resources

Mission Control --> Cluster Manager 

- In this developer service a/c --> invite users --> assign IAM permissions :: 

What is the role of an API in Solace messaging? 

subscriber.session = solace.SolclientFactory.createSession({
    // solace.SessionProperties
    url:      hosturl,
    vpnName:  vpn,
    userName: username,
    password: pass,
});
// define session event listeners
    /*...see section Session Events...*/
// define message event listener
    /*...see section Receiving a message...*/
// connect the session
try {
    subscriber.session.connect();
} catch (error) {
    subscriber.log(error.toString());
}

Where do we hold all the logic or the definitions programmatically that are used by API? :: SDK : Software Development Kit

API --> Try to use the functions [defined] --> SDK 

==> Is it possible to configure access type of queues in Solace CLI? :: YES --> HOW? 

access-type [exclusive | non-exclusive] 

Queue --> Access type is defined 

can i modify the access type directly? :: NO --> Shut down the queue

Guaranteed delivery in case of network failure ? :: YES

S1 : Where is the failure arising : Pub-EBS --> Boundary defition --> 

S2 : Where is the failure arising : EBS-Sub : ACK --> Subscriber has not "process" the message --> ACK is not sent and the message remains in the message spool of EBS

S3 : EBS Software OR EBS Appliance : Appliance --> ADB : Assured Delivery Blade 

What is the maximum size of queue that it can hold? == What is the range of message queued quota in Queue settings : 0 - <max number :: 6M MB> 

5000 - default
